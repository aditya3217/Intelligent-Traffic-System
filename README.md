This project is a real time IOT based traffic regulation system which prioritizes that side of the junction which has more number of vehicles or a vehicle which needs to pass on a priority(ambulances and VIP vehicles). Roads having higher density or emergency vehicles will have a longer green signal time in contrast to other roads which will have a shorter green signal time.
Open CV module of Machine Learning has been used for the detection of vehicles and Arduino as the principal microcontroller for controlling the traffic lights. The images of the traffic on all sides would be sent to the server through the Flask API where the ML model will identify different types of vehicles and their numbers and produce a 2D array. It will run through a series of cases to produce the output in the form of the side which needs a longer duration of opening. Finally, this output will be sent to Arduino which alters the durations of the traffic lights of different sides. This project aims to provide a smart solution in the form of an intelligent traffic light to decongest the traffic.
